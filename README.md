# [My Dearest Love,](https://kani-ko.github.io/Your-Valentines-Page/)

***How dost thou shine, my sweetest star,*
More fair than dawn’s first golden bar?
Thine eyes, twin lanterns of the night,
Outsparkle heaven’s fairest light.

O beauty rare, beyond compare,
Thy presence maketh angels stare.
For in thy face, the gods confide—
A vision pure, love’s perfect guide.

The lilies pale, the roses blench,
For none thy loveliness can quench.
The summer’s breath, the zephyr’s sigh,
Art but a whisper when thou art nigh.

Dost thou not feel the tempest wild
That in my heart beats strong and mild?
For thee it pounds, for thee it breaks,
For thee each pulse its echo makes.

O grant me leave, my heart’s delight,
To love thee well and love thee right.
If love be folly, call me mad,
For never love hath made me glad
As thine—so sweet, so pure, so true—
A love that lives and dies in you.

O jewel of the morning light,
Thy beauty dost outshine the night.
No rose, though bathed in summer’s gold,
Could match thy grace a thousandfold.

Thine eyes, twin stars in midnight’s keep,
Do pierce the soul and bid it weep.
Yet, weep I shall not, lest in vain,
I waste the joy that drowns my pain.

What fickle time, what cruel fate,
That I was not born soon or late,
To meet thee first and love thee last,
And bind thee ‘fore the moment passed!

Thy voice!—a melody most rare,
That charms the winds and soothes the air.
The sirens’ song be hushed and mute,
For none but thee could strike the lute
Of passion’s fire and mercy sweet—
A harmony none may repeat.

Dost thou not hear my heart’s loud wail?
It beats for thee, it shall not fail.
If love be folly, brand me mad!
For never love hath made me glad,
As thine—so wild, so fierce, so true—
A tempest bold, yet ever new.

By heaven’s light and earth’s embrace,
There lives no love in any place,
More bound, more sworn, more high, more deep,
Than mine for thee—eternal keep.


Ever thine, in soul and breath,
Thy Most Devoted Servant
